This is my updated portfolio


This is where I'll be showcasing my:
- projects
- my progress
- my achievements

This is my using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, Javascript. I'll be using SCSS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) as my CSS preprocessor and BEM (Block Element Modifier) for my naming methodology.
